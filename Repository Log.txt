Message:
Can now successfully toggle between Debug mode and game mode after hours of meddling. It worked by assigning a switch logic to run when a button was pressed (one button press switched on and off the modes). This is the first final version. More comments might be needed later on.

Message:
Implemented goal count and try count (10 possible goals for 10 possible tries). Used a flag to indicate ball touching the rim. Implemented separate ball to act as detector while the surface ball moves as intended. tried to implement a reset when ball does not hit rim but did not work. Currently in code but does not do anything, will work on it later. Implemented play mode but is commented out. Rim moves along the x pixel axis making it more difficult to score a goal point.

Message:
Tried fixing the trigger on the goal and try count but to no avail. the clock rate is tricky and very annoying. So for now the counter does things repeatedly and adds or subtracts too much. This is the final main bug to fix.

Message:
Added play mode with 7 segment display showing number of tries and number of goals scored. However i am having problems with the right clock to use to trigger the values and conditions. This is really pissing me off.

Fixed the reset value of the ball and fixed threshold of ball. Initialized ball position and made the ball trigger once for play when button is pushed and waits to be triggered again.

Message:
Modified ball motion. Gravity and vertical initial velocity implemented. Ball decelerates to a peak and drops as expected. Have to fix start up because the ball continuously drops. Ball resets when out of bounds but still drops continuously. Next is to implement Horizontal and vertical start up at button push and reset when out of bounds.

Message:
Implemented Vertical motion however could not implement deceleration of ball upwards. When at zero ball falls to ground at constant speed, but once the ball is initialized vertically, it does not decelerate.
